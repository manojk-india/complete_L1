Okay, I need to help the user by generating Pandas code based on their query. Let's see what they're asking for. The query is: "Story points assigned to Alice in sprint 9 in cdf board." 

First, I remember the rules. I shouldn't filter the data because it's already filtered. So, I'll start by loading the current.csv and history.csv files. 

The example provided uses story points, so I need to calculate the current sprint's total and compare it with the average of previous sprints. I'll sum the story_points in the current DataFrame. For the history, I'll group by sprint and take the mean of the sums.

I should handle cases where there's no historical data. If the history DataFrame is empty, I'll set the average to zero and note that there's no data available.

Then, I'll compare the current points with the average. If current is higher, it's overutilized; if lower, underutilized; else, on par.

Finally, I'll write all this to outputs/output.txt, starting with the query, then the current points, average, and utilization status.

I need to make sure the code is clean, uses vectorized operations, and handles nulls with fillna(0). Also, the code should be executable without errors, so I'll test for any potential issues, like empty DataFrames or division by zero.

Putting it all together, the code should look similar to the example but tailored to the specific query about Alice, sprint 9, and the cdf board.

```python
#code start
import pandas as pd

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv("generated_files/current.csv")        # current sprint data
df_history = pd.read_csv("generated_files/history.csv") # previous sprints data

# Calculate total story points for current sprint
current_points = df['story_points'].fillna(0).sum()

# Calculate average story points from previous sprints
if len(df_history) > 0:
    avg_points = df_history['story_points'].fillna(0).groupby(df_history['sprint']).sum().mean()
else:
    avg_points = 0

# Determine utilization status
if avg_points == 0:
    utilization_status = "No historical data available for comparison."
elif current_points > avg_points:
    utilization_status = "Overutilized"
elif current_points < avg_points:
    utilization_status = "Underutilized"
else:
    utilization_status = "Utilization is on par with historical average"

# Save results to output.txt
with open("outputs/output.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Query: Story points assigned to Alice in sprint 9 in cdf board\n")
    f.write(f"Current sprint story points: {current_points}\n")
    f.write(f"Average of previous sprints: {avg_points:.2f}\n")
    f.write(f"Capacity utilization status: {utilization_status}")
#code end
```
